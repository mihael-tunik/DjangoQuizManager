## About
![image](screenshots/storage_app.png)
This is repository for the QuizManager application.
Main idea of the project is that for simple binary relation:
```
 { 
   "Q1" : "answer_1",
   "Q2" : "answer_2",
   "Q3" : "answer_3", 
   ...
 } 
```
reasonable quiz can be generated by picking right answer and some random subset of alternatives.

Many quizzes behave in this way, including such important examples like word quizzes, alphabet and kanji tests. From the list of questions and right answers in .json format this simple app can construct the quizzes.

Not to mention that this project can be used in educational purposes or as a template for typical Django/React web-application.

## Build with Docker and Nginx
Before you start make sure you have Docker installed (tested on version 20.10.17).

Then in parent project folder run
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
The app should be running in [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
and API should be available on [localhost:8080/api/quizzes/{quiz_id}](http://localhost:8080/api/quizzes)
