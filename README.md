## About
![image](screenshots/storage_app.png)
This is repository for the QuizManager application.
Main idea of the project is that for simple binary relation:
```
 { 
   "Q1" : "answer_1",
   "Q2" : "answer_2",
   "Q3" : "answer_3", 
   ...
 } 
```
reasonable quiz can be generated by picking right answer and some random subset of alternatives.

Many quizzes behave in this way, including such important examples like word quizzes, alphabet and kanji tests. From the list of questions and right answers in .json format this simple app can construct the quizzes.

## Usage
In parent project folder run
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
