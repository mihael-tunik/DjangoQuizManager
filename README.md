## About
![image](screenshots/storage_app.png)
This is repository for the QuizManager application.
Main idea of the project is that most of the quizzes are based on simple binary relation:
```
 { 
   A : B,
   C : D,
   E : F, 
   ...
 } 
```
Then reasonable quiz can be generated by picking right answer and some random subset of alternatives
```
 {
   A? : {B, F},
   C? : {B, D},
   E? : {D, F},
   ...
 }
```
Many quizzes behave in this way, including such important examples like
- Word quizzes;
- Alphabet and kanji tests;
- Math tests.

From the list of questions and right answers in .json format this simple app can construct the quizzes.
